# Migrate Research

Use this skill when multiple styles share a migration failure pattern or when a rich
input pass needs classification before changing `citum_migrate`.

Read first (in a citum-core checkout, or fetch from GitHub):
- `docs/policies/STYLE_WORKFLOW_DECISION_RULES.md`
- `docs/guides/STYLE_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION.md`
- `docs/specs/MIGRATE_RESEARCH_RICH_INPUTS.md`
- `docs/guides/CODEX_SKILLS.md`

Fetch from https://github.com/citum-org/citum-core/blob/main/:
- `docs/policies/STYLE_WORKFLOW_DECISION_RULES.md`
- `docs/guides/STYLE_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION.md`
- `docs/specs/MIGRATE_RESEARCH_RICH_INPUTS.md`

## Use When

- The goal is converter improvement, not a style YAML patch.
- Several styles fail for the same reason.
- You need bounded evidence before deciding whether to fix migration, style, processor,
  or divergence.

## Operating Rules

- Start with the smallest trustworthy evidence surface.
- State the target semantic class and implementation form before proposing a fix.
- Classify each cluster as `migration-artifact`, `style-defect`, `processor-defect`,
  or `intentional divergence`.
- Record the selected parent style when the target is a known wrapper.
- Preserve the config-wrapper contract for `profile + config-wrapper` targets.
- Treat `journal + structural-wrapper` as a valid endpoint; do not force thin-wrapper reduction.
- If a migration-side fix would require local templates or local `type-variants` in a profile,
  stop and reroute or escalate instead of breaking the profile contract.
- Stop when the cluster is clearly out of scope or converged.
- Keep the loop bounded to one cluster per pass.

## Output

Report the chosen cluster, semantic class, implementation form, selected parent if any,
classification, before/after evidence, exact change made if any, and whether the pass
should continue, stop, or escalate.
